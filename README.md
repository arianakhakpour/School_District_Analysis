# School_District_Analysis

## Objectives: 
The objective of this data analysis is to find the releationship between high school math and reading performances as a function of school size, school budget per student and school type (charter/district). 

## Results:
It can be observed that the average student performance at math and reading classes is reversely proportional to the school size, meaning that students from smaller schools are more likely to objain higher scores on both courses (See: [Size vs. Performance](https://github.com/arianakhakpour/Data-Analytics/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)). 
It was also noted that the students' performance is considerably greater at Charter schools, compared to public (District) schools (See: [Type vs. Performance](https://github.com/arianakhakpour/Data-Analytics/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)). 
This analysis also revieled that the students' average score on math and reading is directly porportional to the school budget per student. (See: [Budget vs. Performance](https://github.com/arianakhakpour/Data-Analytics/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)).

## Alterations:
Following the advice of the Academic Integrity Board of Thomas High School, math and reading scores for Grade 9 students were nullified and were replaced by NaN.


## Discussions:

> How is the district summary affected?

Only the row pertaining to Thomas High School has affected, as their grade 9 scores were discarded. 

> How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

The average math and reading scores of Thomas High School has reduced by less than 1% and the overall passing rates has slightly declined to 90.63% from 90.95%. (See: [Summary before alterations](https://github.com/arianakhakpour/Data-Analytics/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx) and [Summary after alterations](https://github.com/arianakhakpour/Data-Analytics/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx))

> How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect, Math and reading scores by grade, Scores by school spending, Scores by school size, and school type?

Reading and Math scores for grades 10, 11, and 12 remains unchanged while the mean scores have slightly declined for grade 9 students. No significant change in performance was observed for the School Size Analysis. 
The alteration in grade 9 data has resulted in minor changes in the Budget Analysis. The overall passing rate for schools allocating $585-629 per student has risen to 90% from 81%. The passing rate for schools assigning $630-644 per student has also increased from 63% to 66%. 
The overall passing rate has dropped by less than 0.1% for Charter Schools while it remained unchanged for District schools following the data alterations.
